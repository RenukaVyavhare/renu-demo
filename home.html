        <h3><u>Planning a camping trip…Here’s what you need to pack</u></h3>
        <p>1) Tent/pillows: A must have for any camper! If you are planning a camping trip, it’s advisable to invest in a good all-weather tent. Also, carry a comfy pillow for a goodnight sleep.
            <br>
            2) Toiletries and first-aid kit: Never ever forget to carry your toiletries and first-aid kit with basic medicines and band-aids. Be prepared for mosquitoes and bug bites when you go camping.
            <br>
            3) Clothes/shoes: If you are planning a camping trip with your children, do carry extra pairs of clothes and shoes. Warm jackets for nights and shorts for the day, along with a pair of socks and good shoes are a must! It’s also advised to carry waterproof shoes and clothing.
